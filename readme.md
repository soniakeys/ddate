Ddate
=====
Discordian date package and command line program.

To install
----------
go get github.com/soniakeys/ddate

Package
-------
The package API is modeled after the time package of the Go standard library.
It is currently rather sparse though, with just a single constructor and the
format function.

Command line program
--------------------
The command line program is modeled after the UNIX ddate command.
The format syntax however, is the syntax accepted by the ddate package.
